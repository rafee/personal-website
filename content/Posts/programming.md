While I'm not a software developer by profession, I do love programming. I solved more than 300 problems in LeetCode and have working proficiency in Python, Go, Java and C++. In my current workplace I wrote multiple python script to automate regular stuff, while saving countless man hours for me and anyone doing the same job as me in the future.

You can take a look at my recent public works in [GitHub](https://github.com/rafee). For obvious reasons, what I do at workplace can't be made public. However, I do intend to write generic documentation about them time to time.
