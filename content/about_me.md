Hi, I am a Hosted Support & Security Analyst at CMiC. Previously, I worked on pre-sales for four years before I moved to Canada for study.

My story started in Bangladesh, a small country in South Asia with massive potential. From my childhood, I was fascinated by science and math. This fascination brought me to study engineering in the best engineering institution in Bangladesh, BUET.

After graduation, I first worked as a pre-sales engineer at Huawei. In that position, I had to communicate with all levels of customers. Some of my customers had years of technical experience. They were concerned with the minute technical details of the solutions. At the same time, CXO level customers were more concerned with the business impact. These experiences let me develop my technical and non-technical abilities simultaneously.

Following that, I switched over to a more sales-oriented role at ZTE, another multinational telecommunication oraganization. There, I got the opportunity to work on a large project (near USD 200M). This project had lots of moving parts, which required constant monitoring. Due to the size of the project, my impact was nominal. However, it was a humbling experience. In addition to that I also worked with some other government and private companies on telecom infrastructure projects.

Then I studied for MEng at the Information Systems Security at Concordia University. While this may seem unconventional (following my experience), it's a continuation of my enthusiasm for Cloud Computing, Networks and Security.

Now at CMiC I make sure our operations in AWS and OCI go smoothly, while following all the best practices in process management. I also analyze our cloud environment and propose changes, that makes us more secure one step at a time.
