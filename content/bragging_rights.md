I hope you won't mind when I brag about my certifications. I passed my first AWS certification in 2017. It was AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate. While that certification expired in 2020, the knowledge didn't. I just didn't get around to recertify due to laziness. Now I made a promise to myself to sit for AWS Certified Security - Specialty this year. While that's a tough one, I'm confident I'll be able to achieve this.

Update: Yay! I completed the [AWS Security Specialty](https://www.credly.com/badges/4e19e69b-314f-416b-84ed-2a6c3701da1a/public_url). Will pursue either CCSP or OCI Security Professional now. Not decided yet.

In the meantime I got a certification from Google Cloud, GCP Certified Associate Cloud Engineer, which is at the same level as AWS certification, just for GCP. You can take a look at the actual certificate [here](https://www.credential.net/1b0433d3-2ed6-4c4d-a7a4-12eab5d42e66?key=2c15ed7cd9ff1bfc197404d1645ccfd54d8bf7c0b8308b385f685310f3b34097). I also got certified by Oracle on security. The official name of the certification is Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Security 2021 Certified Associate. This certification tests my knowledge about different security services in Oracle Cloud, as well as a basic understanding of OCI. You can take a look at my this achievement [here](https://catalog-education.oracle.com/pls/certview/sharebadge?id=4FC148C040263C1B38B5DFDF309396CE194D01F7B8B92BABBC019DB9EE0B0DA0).

My bragging won't be complete without mentioning my graduate degree in Information Systems Security from Concordia University, Montreal. While the certifications might carry more practical knowledge about specific tools and environments, I believe theoritical knowledge still has it's place. The masters degree from Concordia University defintely made me a more accomplished engineer with deeper than surface level knowledge in information security.
