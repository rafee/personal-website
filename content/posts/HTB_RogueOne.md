I've recently dedicated some time to delve deeper into the realms of hacking and incident response. While this field is expansive, and each individual has their preferred learning method, I've discovered that Hack The Box (HTB) aligns best with my learning style. My reasoning behind this preference is that, unlike many other platforms, HTB strives to simulate real-world issues more closely. By tackling challenges on HTB, one acquires skills directly applicable to real-life scenarios. This sets it apart from Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which often lean more towards resembling problems found on platforms like LeetCode.

The initial challenge I tackled was RogueOne. Here's the problem statement:

`Your SIEM system generated multiple alerts in less than a minute, indicating potential C2 communication from Simon Stark's workstation. Despite Simon not noticing anything unusual, the IT team had him share screenshots of his task manager to check for any unusual processes. No suspicious processes were found, yet alerts about C2 communications persisted. The SOC manager then directed the immediate containment of the workstation and a memory dump for analysis. As a memory forensics expert, you are tasked with assisting the SOC team at Forela to investigate and resolve this urgent incident.`

The problem provided a 1 GB memory dump that required analysis. I utilized Volatility 3, which as far as I know, is the most widely used tool for such tasks. If there's a superior alternative, I'd welcome suggestions in the comments. It's worth noting that the default unzip tool in Windows failed to extract the file without requesting a password; however, when I opened the zip file with PeaZip, I was prompted for a password. If anyone has insights into this issue, I'd greatly appreciate any comments on that too.

Our initial task is to pinpoint the malicious process and input its process ID. Our primary approach involves identifying all processes engaged in outbound communication with the C&C server. Typically, knowing the IP address of the C&C server serves as a clear indicator. However, as the IP is not provided here, we must rely on alternative clues. We proceed by executing the following command.

`vol -f 20230810.mem windows.netstat.NetStat > outputs/netstat.txt`

Let's dissect this command. `vol` refers to the volatility3 program. The `-f` argument specifies that the subsequent argument will be the input memory dump. In volatility2, one would have to specify the profile for memory analysis, but in volatility3, this is defined through the plugin name. The next argument, `windows.netstat.NetStat`, denotes the plugin to be executed, which outputs the list of connections in the system or memory. The final set of arguments, `> outputs/netstat.txt`, redirects the output to a file named `netstat.txt` within the `outputs` directory. This setup aims to preserve artifacts, anticipating multiple analyses on the output, which might take considerable time to generate depending on the system.

First lets take a look at first couple of lines of output.
![Netstat Output](/images/Netstat.jpg)

In this output, we observe various lines indicating connections marked either as `ESTABLISHED` or `CLOSE_WAIT`, alongside some denoted as `LISTENING`, which becomes evident upon scrolling down further.
Given the emphasis on active connections in the problem statement, we'll narrow our focus solely to those marked as `ESTABLISHED`. This will be accomplished using the following command:

`grep -n "ESTABLISHED" outputs/netstat.txt`

`grep` is the tool used for text search, and the `-n` argument directs it to display line numbers. `"ESTABLISHED"` denotes the pattern we're searching for, while the last part simply represents the filename. The resulting output is as follows:

![Grep Established](/images/grep_established.jpg)

Things are starting to get intriguing! We've observed four instances of the `svchost.exe` application connected to the internet. Among these, three are linked to port `443`, while one is connected to port `8888`. While this method isn't foolproof, my initial speculation is that port `443` is likely normal and used for `HTTPS`, whereas the service connected to port `8888` should be regarded as suspicious. However, before reaching a final conclusion, let's delve into what `svchost.exe` actually does. According to [lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/scvhost-exe-4174462):

`The purpose for svchost.exe is to, as the name would imply, host services. Windows uses it to group services that need access to the same DLLs to run in one process, helping to reduce their demand for system resources.`

This seems innocent. However, it's important to note that malware developers often use innocuous names for their programs to camouflage among legitimate and necessary components. Therefore, let's delve one step deeper. We'll attempt to examine other processes in the system by using the following command to retrieve the list of all running processes.

`vol -f 20230810.mem windows.pslist.PsList > outputs/pslist.txt`

As before, we're preserving the outputs to a file for multiple analyses. Next, we'll search for `svchost.exe` in the file.

`grep -n 'svchost.exe' outputs/pslist.txt`

A segment of the output is as follows:
![pslist](/images/pslist.jpg)

We discover something very interesting here. Except pid `6812` and `936`, all other processes have pid `788` as the parent. For these two, the parent is pid `7436`. Let's try to search more details of the pid `788` and `7436`. For pid `788` we get a large number of results, so let's try to look at only the first one, as we are interested in the process itself, not it's childs for now. For `788` the command is:

`grep '788' -m 1 outputs/pslist.txt`

And it's output:

![788](/images/788.jpg)

For `7436`, the output is:

![7436](/images/7436.jpg)

With this analysis, we can confidently identify our malicious process ID as `6812`. The rationale behind this conclusion is that while `services.exe` is a common service responsible for launching `svchost.exe`, `explorer.exe` typically corresponds to the Windows File Explorer. Hence, pid `6812` stands out as the malicious process. Therefore, the answer to task 1 is:

`6812`

For Task 2, which entails finding the process spawned by the malicious process, we apply the same approach as before and execute the following command:

`grep -n '6812' outputs/pslist.txt`

We get this output:

![6812 Child](/images/6812.jpg)

Our result for task 2:

`4364`

The next task asks us to find the md5 hash of the malicious program file. To get the malicious program from memory we use the following command:

`vol -f 20230810.mem -o 6812 windows.dumpfile --pid 6812`

Here `-o` defines the output directory, `--pid 6812` defines our targeted pid and the other argument is name of the plugin used. The output is as follows:

![Dump output](/images/6812_dump.jpg)

While we can see a lots of dll files as output, for us the most important one is `file.0x9e8b91ec0140.0x9e8b957f24c0.ImageSectionObject.svchost.exe.img`. Running `md5sum` on the file we get our result for task 3:

`5bd547c6f5bfc4858fe62c8867acfbb5`

For task 4 we were asked to provide the C2 IP address and port. We can search on `netstat.txt` to find the result for this. The command we can use is:

`grep -n 6812 outputs/netstat.txt`

The output:

![Task 4 Result](/images/task_4.jpg)

Result for task 4:

`13.127.155.166:8888`

As for the time the connection was established, we can get that from previous output.

Result for task 5:

`10/08/2023 11:30:03`

We are asked for memory offset of the malicious process in task 6. To get that, we run:

`grep -n 6812 outputs/pslist.txt`

Result for task 6:

`0x9e8b87762080`

For task 7, we were asked to submit it to virustotal and determine, when it was first submitted. After submitting we get that the file was first submitted on August 10, 2023 at 11:58:10. The result for task 6:

`10/08/2023 11:58:10`

And voil√†, the problem is completed!
